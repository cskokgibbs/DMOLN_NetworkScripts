# DMOL Network Priors, Inference, and Reconstruction Run Scripts

This repo contains network inference run scripts for MTL inferelator (Skok Gibbs et al., 2022) networks used in (Ã–zel et al., 2022) are included in Network_Run_Scripts.
Command line arguments to generate network priors the Inferelator-Prior (https://github.com/flatironinstitute/inferelator-prior) are also included in Prior_Run_Scripts.
